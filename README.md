== Welcome to omgrails
Ruby on Rails I was told, is a great way to develop stuff for the web.  So in a class where 
the goal is to create a web app in a month, I've been fiddling around and realized that 
there is great potential in Ruby on Rails; unfortunately a lot of sources are in OSX...

I run Win7.  So the file names for things in the terminal are different. 
Locations for things are different.

A lot of great answers to frustratingly simple problems can be found at stackoverflow...
But it's scattered all over the place!

They said Ruby on Rails was harder to deal with (especially on windows) before hand. 
I can't imagine how that must've been.

Anyways.  If you're reading this, I'll probably put in a few notes along the way as I make progress.
